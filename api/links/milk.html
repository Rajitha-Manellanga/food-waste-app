  <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
  <p>The production of milk products can have a negative impact on the environment.
    The dairy industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution,
    and land degradation. However, some dairy farms are adopting sustainable practices to reduce their
    environmental impact. These practices include using renewable energy sources, reducing water usage,
    and improving waste management.

  <h2>Animal Welfare</h2>
  <p>The welfare of dairy cows is also an important consideration when evaluating the
    sustainability of milk products. Some dairy farms use intensive farming practices that can be

    prioritize animal welfare and use practices such as pasture-based farming and providing access to
    clean water and nutritious feed.
